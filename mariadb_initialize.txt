mkdir data

-- execute the command on a admin DOS CMD prompt
%userprofile%\mariadb\bin\mariadb-install-db.exe --datadir=..\data\


-- to start mariadb using the admin DOS CMD prompt
"%userprofile%\mariadb\bin\mariadbd.exe" --defaults-file="%userprofile%\mariadb\data\my.ini" --console

-- find a low, med or high availibility compute node my.ini or my.cnf file from mariadb.org 
-- and copy the contents to that data\my.ini location replacing the existing contents.

-- after this service has started, there is no password for the root user
-- You have to log in as root: mariadb.exe -u root -p mysql

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';
ALTER USER 'root'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';
-- create a new user on mysql using root account
CREATE USER 'the_hobbit'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';

so, i had an older version of mariadb 10.11.x from a year or so ago. the latest version is 10.11.6.
to upgrade, all you had to do is to download the latest zip file w/o the debug stuff and delete the existing
four dirs along with the four text file and copy those new dirs and files into mariadb dir leaving the data dir alone.
This will upgrade your entire mariadb node in a nutshell.
